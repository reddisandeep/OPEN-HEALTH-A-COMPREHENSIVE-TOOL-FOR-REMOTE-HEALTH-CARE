# OpenHealth: A Comprehensive AI Tool for Remote Health Care

## About The Project

In an era where healthcare demands precision, accessibility, and personalised solutions, "OpenHealth" emerges as a groundbreaking initiative at the intersection of technology and medicine. This comprehensive project focuses on Multi-Disease Detection, employing a diverse set of algorithms, including traditional machine learning models, deep learning models, transfer learning, and hybrid models such as VGG-19, ResNet50, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Diseases across specific organs, such as the brain, kidney, heart, liver, and lungs, are accurately predicted, and model performance is rigorously assessed through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Adding a layer of sophistication, "OpenHealth" integrates with large language models from Open-source libraries like Hugging Face and GenerativeAI from Google, providing personalised information based on individual health profiles. Furthermore, the project extends its impact by incorporating an AI dietitian and food recommender, tailoring dietary recommendations to individual health conditions. Meticulous organisation is ensured through dedicated directory structures, fostering a modular and maintainable framework. Leveraging Machine Learning operations like Dockers, Data Version Control, and MLflow enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of healthcare systems. In essence, "OpenHealth" represents a transformative force that leverages cutting-edge technologies to usher in a new era of healthcare characterised by accuracy, personalization, and efficiency.

## Getting Started

This will help you understand how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Installation from GitHub

Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to install the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/reddisandeep/OpenHealth.git
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
     ```
     conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (Optional)
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```
       conda activate <Environment_Name>/
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**
   - Start the project by running the appropriate command.
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

6. **Access the Project**
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.


### Option 2: Installation from DockerHub (Coming Soon)

If you prefer to use Docker, you can install and run the project using a Docker container from DockerHub:

1. **Pull the Docker Image**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to pull the Docker image from DockerHub:
     ```
     docker pull reddisandeep/<IMAGE>
     ```
     This command downloads the Docker image from the DockerHub.

2. **Run the Docker Container**
   - Start the Docker container by running the following command. Adjust the port mapping as needed:
     ```
     docker run -p 5000:5000 reddisandeep/<IMAGE>
     ```
     This command launches the project within a Docker container.

3. **Access the Project**
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.<br>
